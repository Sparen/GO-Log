# SparenofIria's Pokémon GO Log

Hello viewers, and welcome to my log of Pokémon GO encounters in the vicinity of Johns Hopkins University.

I will update this with every encounter I find, regardless of the Pokémon, with the goal of determining spawn locations, nests, and other potential goodies. 

## Usage

_pokestops.html: visual representation of Pokéstops and Gyms in the JHU area. Note that it is not complete.
all_loc.html: visual representation of spawn locations, as well listings for each spawn location
all.html: all Pokémon in database dumped onto one map

All HTML files prefixed with a given Pokémon's name will have all encounters with that evolution chain, and are named after the base form. For example, tyrogue.html will house Tyrogue, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Hitmontop. 

All times are Eastern Standard Time. All locations are based off of Master.png and are in pixels. I do not plan to map anything larger than the area provided here.

## JSON

For reference, JSON files are organized as follows:
* Gym/Pokéstop: Alphabetized by name (as shown when you open the location in-game). 
* Pokémon: Listed in order of encounter, with newer entries at the bottom. Date is Year Month Day. Time is EST. Images are from Bulbapedia and the filenames use the National Dex number for the given Pokémon.
