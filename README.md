# SparenofIria's Pokémon GO Log

Hello viewers, and welcome to my log of Pokémon GO encounters in the vicinity of Johns Hopkins University.

I will update this with every encounter I find, regardless of the Pokémon, with the goal of determining spawn locations, nests, and other potential goodies. 

NOTE: No longer maintained as of August 18, 2016

## Usage

_pokestops.html: visual representation of Pokéstops and Gyms in the JHU area. Note that it is not complete.

all_loc.html: visual representation of spawn locations, as well listings for each spawn location

all.html: all Pokémon in database dumped onto one map, with toggleable Pokémon settings

All times are Eastern Standard Time. All locations are based off of Master.png and are in pixels. I do not plan to map anything larger than the area provided here.
